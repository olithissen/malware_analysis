# Malware Downloader Analysis
This is an annotated version of the malware downloader that I got in my inbox today. Since I always wanted to have a look at how they work, I took some time beautifying, deobfuscating and commenting it.

## Contribute
If you have anything to add: Please do so!

## A Note Of Warning
I strongly advise against running this thing unless you know what you are doing. The commented version is safeguarded with the actual malware EXECUTION disabled, but the malware will still be downloaded.

## A Note Of Clarification ...
I hope it's not necessary to point this out explicitly: The original JavaScript file you're seeing here was in no way conceived or programmed by me. I just want to take a closer look at it.
